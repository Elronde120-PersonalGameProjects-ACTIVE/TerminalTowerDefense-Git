	1: cost entry is what the user must pay to create the tower
	2: damage entry is how much damage the tower does to enemies per hit
	3: range is how far can the tower see enemies
3: Create the TowerDBEntry scriptable object
	1: name entry is what the user will type in to reference a specific tower
	2: desc enrty is what appears when the user inspects the tower object
